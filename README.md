# Elective-Processing-System
Amrita being one of the biggest institutions in India, the system we propose will be developed with the needs of both faculties and students in mind, so that every student will be assigned an optional choice at the end of the process.
In  summary, the process will be carried out in two phases, prior to which the faculties will be given a slot to list the courses that will be provided, as well as the minimum and maximum student cap for each course. 
Once the first round is available, students can indicate their priority for each course, and we will utilise the FCFS (First Come, First Serve) method to assign courses to students based on their preferences. 
We now have a list of courses with their vacancies. Courses with less than the minimum cap arewithdrawn, and students who were assigned to courses that are no longer offered will participate in round 2. 
The process concludes with shifting such students based on FCFS into other available courses with student counts ranging between the minimum and maximum cap.
